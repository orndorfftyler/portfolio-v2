# portfolio-v2

[Portfolio web page](https://orndorfftyler.github.io/portfolio-v2/) with flexbox, navigation, and HTML form. 

For this more advanced version of my portfolio website, I used flexbox in my custom CSS. I also added an HTML form in the contact section. There are new links in the navigation bar that lead to different sections of the webpage. 

I look forward to updating this site with links to my future projects!

Built with HTML, CSS.
